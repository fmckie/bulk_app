Chapter 1
Gregory to The Rescue
My name is Greg O’Gallagher and in this manual I am going to
teach you my methods to building a beautifully proportioned,
strong and muscular physique.

This program is going to be much different than any other
strength or muscle building course you have ever read.

The workouts, exercises, sets and reps are all geared towards
bringing your body closer to what I call the “Kinobody”
physique.

This is categorized by a strong V-­‐shaped torso, sculpted
shoulders, prominent square pecs, rock hard arms, a taut waist
(with the “v-­‐cut” women love) and lean and fit looking legs.

This is the exact physique that I have coined as the ‘Kinobody’.
The word ‘kino’ is used in the seduction community to describe
physical touch between a guy and girl. This is one of the most
important aspects of seduction to ensure you stay out of the
dreadful Friend Zone.

In fact, “kino” is used to get the girl to think of you in more of a
sexual way. By building a Kinobody physique, you will look
great and radiate so much confidence that women won’t be
able to keep their hands off you!

Hence “kino-­‐body”, or Kinobody.

Think of me as Michelangelo and by following my workout
and nutrition protocols I will sculpt you into a piece of art.

At first you might be surprised by the simplicity of the
workouts. This is because you won’t be training 5-­‐6x per week,
you won’t be doing 5 exercises per muscle group and you
won’t be using all kinds of fancy bodybuilding techniques.

Those methods are great if all you care about is getting insane
pumps and crazy muscle soreness. However, if you’re more
concerned with building real strength and muscle and actually
making consistent progress then you need to abide by a whole
new set of rules and training principles.

When it comes to building the lean and muscular
physique, focus on increasing strength in the 4-­‐8 rep
range.

This will deliver 75% of your results.

If you focus on gaining strength with the right movements you
will gain the perfect amount of muscle for your physique. More
importantly, it will be highly useful, dense and powerful
muscle.

In conjunction with a specific diet protocol to minimize fat and
promote muscle you will be left with a chiseled GREEK GOD-­‐
like physique.

Who Is This Program For?
This program is for determined men who want to build the
ideal lean and muscular physique of Hollywood’s fittest. I’m

talking about guys like Brad Pitt in Troy, Daniel Craig in Casino
Royale, Christian Bale in American Psycho, Ryan Reynolds in
Blade Trinity, Chris Evans in Captain America.... These guys all
have a nice looking amount of muscle combined with minimal
fat.

This program is for determined men who want to be much
stronger and more powerful than they look. “Looking good”
just doesn’t cut it.

This program is for men who want to be a godlike in strength
and aesthetics. Some people believe you can’t be lean and
strong. Well that’s hogwash.

If that was the case I wouldn’t be able to bench press 315 lbs,
but guess what? I can.

In fact, for the type of strength we are after you have to be very
lean. We are after RELATIVE STRENGTH, which is strength
relative to your bodyweight.

This program is for men who like to enjoy life. What’s the point
in looking good if your life revolves around your training and
diet?

...There IS no point. It’s a complete waste. In fact for most
people reading this program they are going to need to spend
less time in the gym and more time enjoying life.

This program is for men with patience. You will NOT be able to
gain 5-­‐10 lbs of muscle per month! This rate of muscle growth
just isn’t in the cards.

The only way for this to be possible is if you are regaining
muscle that was previously lost or if you are using large
amounts of anabolic steroids. Those that try to pack on muscle
very quickly end up gaining a whole bunch of fat and ruin their
physiques.

Beginner and intermediate lifters can gain a maximum of
2 -­‐3 lbs of muscle per month.

While this might sound slow, it’s really not.

Most people need to gain 15-­‐20 lbs maximum of muscle to
achieve the muscularity of the Kinobody physique. This takes
months to a year to achieve.

Working out is something that I want you to continue for life.
If you could build a jacked physique in two to three months
then there would be a lot more muscular guys walking around.

With that said, most guys actually think they need to gain 30-­‐
40 lbs of muscle to look impressive. This is most definitely not
the case.

You see, most guys trying to build muscle tend to overeat as
well as do lots of squats and deadlifts. This leads to excess fat
gain and excess lowerbody mass.

If these people were only to gain 15-­‐20 lbs of muscle, their
physiques wouldn’t change a whole lot. However when you
focus on gaining pure muscle and adding that muscle to the
right places in the right amounts, then 15-­‐20 lbs looks
incredible! The difference is absolutely night and day.

Chapter 2
The Ultimate Kinobody Physique
Over my years of working out and transforming my body,
people have always asked me why I workout.

I tell them, “I workout because as far as I’m concerned, I only
have one body and I want it to be as damn healthy, fit and
powerful as possible. So tell me, why don’t you workout?
What’s stopping you from making the small investment that is
working out and taking care of yourself that will pay off BIG
TIME?”

As a child I always found it incredible that YOU determine
how your body looks, feels and functions.

Working out a few times per week and taking care of yourself
is a small price to pay for a physique that FEELS, LOOKS and
PERFORMS AMAZING. Don’t you think?

Relative Strength: The Key to the Ultimate
Lean & Muscular Physique
Let me ask you a question:

What is more impressive, a 220 lbs dude that benches 315 lbs or
a 175 lbs dude that benches 315?

The 175 lbs guy is much more impressive, of course. This is
because the 175 lbs guy is much lighter, but has the same
strength as the bigger guy. Therefore, the lighter guy must
have a higher percentage of lean body mass (very low body fat)

and the muscle he does have is going to be much more dense
and powerful (useful muscle).

Relative Strength is the key to building the perfect
physique.

Get as strong as possible relative to your bodyweight. This will
ensure you have a good amount of muscle and very little body
fat.

When your strength to weight ratio increases you will have a
good indicator that you gained muscle, lost fat or gained
muscle and lost fat.

Every workout should be constructed in such a way to
maximize strength gains.

This will build muscle more effectively in the long term.

From my experience, people get way too caught up in hitting
their muscles from different angles, feeling the burn, and using
high fatigue methods such as drop sets and super sets.

These methods have their place but should never replace
heavy lifting. One thing remains true: to build muscle you need
to lift heavier and heavier weights overtime.

Want to build muscle? Build strength!

Want a big chest? Work your way up to incline barbell bench
press with 225 lbs for 5 reps.

Want a big back? Work up to chin-­‐ups with 90 lbs attached for
5 reps.

You will never see someone lacking in the muscle department
that can do both those tasks. That I can guarantee.

What you WILL see is someone complaining about his flat
chest whose workout routine consists of many different chest
exercises all performed to failure with super sets and drop sets
mixed in.

Their bench press probably hasn’t improved since the first
time they benched 185 lbs. Instead they should focus on
improving strength instead of causing fatigue. Muscle follows
strength.

Want to improve muscular endurance? Build Strength!

I can’t stress how important gaining strength is for improving
performance. Building strength is an effective way to improve
muscular endurance.

For example, who do you think can do more reps with 150 lbs
on the bench press a 200 lbs bencher or a 300 lbs bencher?

(Definitely the 300 lbs bencher.)

Want to increase power? Build Strength!

Who do you think can launch their body up over a wall with
more power, a guy who can do pull ups with 100 lbs attached
or a guy who can only do pull ups with 20 lbs attached?

(Obviously the guy with 100 lbs can.)

Want to look awesome? Build Relative Strength!

Building strength relative to your bodyweight is the key to the
ultimate physique that is lean, powerful and functional.

The key to gaining relative strength is to focus on building as
much strength as possible while keeping body fat to an
absolute minimum. Training is designed to generate increases
in strength and diet is designed to keep fat to a minimum and
support muscle growth.

The combination of the two results in incredible relative
strength.

How to Build Super Strength & Dense Hard
Muscle
First things first: there are two different forms of muscle
growth. You have myofibrillar hypertrophy and sarcoplasmic
hypertrophy.

Myofibrillar hypertrophy is the growth of your muscle fibers
and is trigged by lifting heavy weights for low reps (3-­‐8) with
long rest periods. Training for myofibrillar hypertrophy builds
hard, dense looking muscle that will be highly useful since it is
accompanied by large increases in strength.

This type of muscle growth is our predominant focus.

Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is the growth of the fluid within
your muscle cells and is trigged by high volume lifting with sub
maximal weights and short rest periods.

Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy only accounts for about 25% of
muscle growth.

Think of it as the icing on the cake. It doesn’t take much to
trigger this additional muscle growth but it will allow you to
walk around with 5 to 8 more pounds of muscle.

This type of training is fun to do because it delivers a great
muscle pump. Unfortunately, most people get distracted by this
type of training and neglect what really matters – building
strength.

Therefore this type of lifting will only be a small component of
the workout program.

Chapter 3
Revamping Your Training
With this strength-­‐training program we are going to be
diligently tracking four different exercises which I feel most
strongly contribute to the aesthetic physique we’re after.

These will be our ‘indicator exercises’ and will ensure we are
making progress on a regular basis.

As you become stronger on these movements your body will
change for the better. Your chest, shoulders, arms and back will
begin to fill out perfectly as you drop fat from the diet. You will
move closer towards a very strong V-­‐shaped torso, masculine
square chest and rock hard shoulders and arms.

By tracking your four indicator exercises you will have
visual proof of the effectiveness of your workout routine.

Most people judge their routine based on how tough it is and
how sore it makes them. Unfortunately, that means very little if
progress isn’t made consistently.

The effectiveness of your training is directly related to the
progress on these four exercises. By accepting that, your
training program will become 10x more effective. You will
direct your efforts on that which will make you stronger and
more muscular and divert your attention away from
everything that is a distraction.

Every exercise, every set and every rep has a purpose.

Kinobody Indicator Exercises
1.) Incline Barbell Bench Press

There is nothing wrong with the regular (flat bench) barbell
bench press. It is a terrific exercise at building the whole
pectoral region if done properly .

With that said, I feel that most people would benefit more from
the incline version, which develops the upper pecs better. In
addition, in most athletic pressing movements the arms push
forward at a slightly upward angle as opposed to directly
straight out. An example of this would be pushing a car or
throwing a punch.

For this reason the incline press may be more relevant from a
functional standpoint.

2.) Standing Shoulder Press

This is my go-­‐to exercise for shoulder development and true
strength. This exercise also seems to contribute to the ‘square
chest look’ by filling in the top area of the chest just under the
collarbone.

In addition, standing presses will work the triceps very hard. I
recommend avoiding seated shoulder presses with the elbows
flared out to the side. This is a very unnatural position for the
shoulders and overtime may cause pain and injury.

3.) Weighted Chin ups

Chin-­‐ups have developed my back so well that I’ve actually
avoided doing any additional work for my lats. In addition,

chin-­‐ups hit the biceps very hard. Lat pull downs and rows
don’t even come close to the effectiveness of weighted chin-­‐
ups.

With chin-­‐ups you can’t cheat and use momentum or a swing
like you can with rows and pull downs. In addition, chin-­‐ups
are a closed chain exercise whereas lat pull down and rows are
open chain exercises. What this means is that with chin-­‐ups
your hands are fixed to the bar while your body is moving
through space.

Closed chain movements have greater overall muscle
recruitment and lead to better muscle and strength gains from
my experience.

4.) Power Cleans from Hang (or Sumo Deadlifts)

This is a very athletic movement that builds great power
through the legs, hips, back and traps. I avoid direct leg
training because it tends to over develop my legs and
contributes to the ‘sweep’ that I consider feminine.

I have found that hang cleans bring about explosive power but
without the leg mass that squats build.

I have also found hang cleans to be the most effective exercise
at developing my trap muscles. Shrugs don’t do anything for
my traps but hang cleans get them every time. Lastly since
dedicating my time to hang cleans I have noticed a big increase
in my jumping abilities. With that being said, hang cleans are a
very technical movement and can be difficult to learn. You can
perform sumo deadlifts instead if hang cleans aren’t practical
for you.

Kinobody Assistance Movements
I always include additional exercises into the workout routines
I create. You could exclusively train with the four indicator
exercises and you could build a great physique. However, it is
likely that you will develop lagging muscle groups and hit
strength plateaus.

To ensure complete physique development and optimal muscle
gains I include assistance movements. These are my favorites:

Weighted Dips

Weighted dips are a fantastic exercise for adding massive
amounts of pressing strength and gaining muscle to the triceps
and pectoral region.

Some exercises are very stubborn when it comes to
progressing in weight. Weighted dips are not one of those
exercises. They tend to go up very smoothly and if you train
this exercise properly you should be able to add 45 lbs to this
exercise in 3 months time.

That is a huge gain and would result in bigger triceps, fuller
chest and a stronger bench.

Close Grip Bench Press

The close grip bench is a phenomenal pressing movement that
builds a powerful chest and triceps. By using a close grip with
the elbows tucked into your sides you increase muscle
recruitment in the triceps and upper chest.

Barbell Curls

The barbell curl is the best exercise for developing the biceps.
With this movement you can make gradual progress in
resistance used.

In most biceps exercises, very little strength increase is
actually seen. For this reason I use barbell curls as my main
biceps exercise.

You can eventually build up to barbell curls with 135 lbs for
your reps.

Incline Dumbbell Curls

Incline dumbbell curls are very effective because your arms are
locked to the sides and your back is flat against the bench. It is
in this position that you are unable to use any back swing, the
biceps are forced to work in isolation.

I like to alternate between barbell curls and incline dumbbell
for three to four weeks at a time.

Skull Crushers

Skull crushers hit the triceps very hard and allow for regular
loading in weight. For this reason skull crushers should be
your main triceps movement.

As with barbell curls, you can build up to 135+ lbs for reps.
This is a killer exercise and will translate to better pushing
strength, most specifically in the lock out.

Rope Extensions

Rope triceps push downs (rope extensions) are another great
triceps exercise. This movement is better suited for higher
reps, less weight and short rest periods. For that reason I like
to use them for pump training.

Lateral Raises

To ensure perfect shoulder development I always include
lateral raises into my workout programs. The medial head of
the deltoid never gets fully worked with shoulder pressing.
Most of the stress for shoulder pressing is placed on the
anterior head.

For this reason the medial head can slightly lag behind in
overall growth. Therefore lateral raises should be incorporated
to ensure even muscle growth.

In addition, by adequately building the medial head of the
shoulder you will contribute to the V-­‐shaped frame that is so
desired.

Bent Over Flyes

Strong rear delts will help keep your shoulders balanced and
healthy. This will ensure you stay injury free from heavy
pressing movements. Well-­‐developed rear delts will complete
the shoulders giving them a full, rounded appearance.

Fully developed shoulders are a true sign of masculinity and
dominance.

One Legged Squats (aka Pistols)

Pistol squats are an unbelievable exercise that I regularly
incorporate into my routine.

The benefits of mastering the pistol squat are enormous. The
pistol requires great balance, leg strength, flexibility and
coordination. For most people building up to six to ten reps per
leg, slow and controlled is enough for adequate leg strength
and development.

You can perform this exercise holding a weight in your hands
to increase the difficulty. Another option is to perform jumping
pistol squats where you explode up from the bottom position
into a single leg jump.

Single Leg Calf Raises on a Step

For most people I feel it is important to do some direct lower
leg training. Small calves create the illusion of chicken legs that
most girls hate. By training your calves and keeping them
around the same size of your upper arm you will have a
balanced, proportionate look.

Besides, well-­‐developed calves are very impressive. On the
other hand huge, bulky thighs are undesirable and look sloppy
and detract from your upper body development.

Chapter 4
Reverse Pyramid Training:
Maximizing Muscle and Strength Gains
Reverse pyramid training is by far the most effective training
style I have ever used in regards to muscle and strength gains.

Unfortunately very few people employ this very simple
technique. In fact, most people train in the exact opposite way.

Most people will grab a weight and pump out 12-­‐15 reps. After
a brief rest they will add weight and pump out another 10-­‐ 12
reps. They will repeat this process until they hit a weight that
causes them to hit failure in the 5-­‐8 rep range.

The problem with this is that they become semi fatigued for
their heaviest set. As a result they end up using a weight that is
lighter than their true 5-­‐8 rep max. Because they are lifting
below their true potential they never promote optimal
strength and muscle gains.

I recommend flipping the script and performing your
heaviest set first while you are completely fresh.

Your heavy set is really your money set and has the greatest
capacity at triggering maximum strength and muscle gains.
However, in order to get the maximum training effect it is
essential that you perform the heavy set while you are
completely fresh to maximize performance output.

After performing your heavy set and scoring a nice personal
record you can follow this up with a few more sets with
gradually reduced loads.

The subsequent sets will be less demanding on your
neural system since you will be lifting lighter loads.

This is important because we don’t want to overtax our
nervous system. The purpose of these extra sets is to simply
provide more volume to the working muscles. This will
encourage optimal muscle gains.

Now here is where the magic of reverse pyramid training
comes in...

You will notice that your heavy set will make your subsequent
sets feel very light. The heavy set induces a high degree of
central nervous system stimulation, resulting in greater motor
unit recruitment and force, which can last for several minutes.

As a result you get better muscle fiber recruitment than
normal with lighter weights if you do them after your
heavy set.

Since you will get more muscle fiber activation in your lighter
sets you will stimulate hypertrophy much more effectively.

This is because with loads below 80-­‐85% of your One Rep Max
(1RM) many of your muscle fibers don’t get activated until the
last few reps.

With reverse pyramid training you can get those muscle fibers
to come into play from the very first rep. This is a huge deal
when it comes to maximizing muscle growth.

Warming Up For Your Heavy Set
We can’t jump right into our heavy set or injury will be
inevitable. For that reason I recommend a very specific warm
up.

The best way to prepare for your heavy set while avoiding
fatigue is to perform 2-­‐3 gradually heavier build up sets for
only 1-­‐5 reps.

I usually recommend using a weight that is 60% of your work
set weight for 5 reps then 75% of your work set weight for 3
reps and then 90% of your work set weight for 1 rep.

You should rest around 2 minutes between these ‘build up sets’
and a full 3 minutes before doing your first work set.

The warm up sets are only necessary for the first exercise of a
given workout. After than you should be ready to jump right
into your work set for all remainder exercises.

That being said, you should judge how you feel. If you think
you need a couple build up sets, then by all means take them.
(Better that than risk injury.)

Example for 225 lbs bench press for 5 reps:

135 lbs x 5 (60%)
170 lbs x 3 (75%)
200 lbs x 1 (90%)
Reverse Pyramid Training Specifics
Generally, your heavy set should be performed with a weight
that allows you to perform between 4-­‐ 8 reps with maximum
effort (stop one rep shy of failure).

After performing your first set you should reduce the weight
by approximately 10% and then perform your second set
striving for 1-­‐2 more reps.

If you are doing 3 sets then you will reduce the weight by
another 10% and shoot for an additional 1-­‐2 reps.

Example:

225 lbs x 5 (heavy set – max effort)
205 lbs x 6
185 lbs x 8
You should take at-­‐least 3 minutes rest between these sets for
maximum recovery and lifting performance. Rushing through
these sets will drastically reduce your strength capabilities.

Chapter 5
The Art of Strength Progressions
Probably the most underrated aspect of most peoples’ workout
programs is the strength progression system. Without a proper
progression model in place gains will be marginal at best.

Unfortunately, most progression models are highly flawed.

You see, after an intense and productive strength training
session your body will recover and improve ever so slightly. An
increase of 1 to 2.5% is usually the upper limit of what can be
seen from workout to workout. Beginners may be able to
increase by 2.5% every workout and more advanced lifters
may only be able to increase by 1% per workout.

The typical training method is to stick with a given weight until
you hit the upper threshold of the rep range you are working
in.

The problem with this is that adding a single rep to an exercise
increases the predicted one rep max by 3% or more. 3% is a
very lofty increase and it is near impossible to maintain that
rate of increase on a regular basis.

This is one of the reasons that many people hit plateaus in
the gym: they are using a flawed training system.

Now if you were to stick with the same rep range and just add
5 lbs to the bar that could be an increase of 2.5% to 5%
assuming you are lifting somewhere between 100 and 2 00 lbs.

This is really pushing the limit especially if you are lifting
closer to 100 lbs.

Micro Loading: The Fix to the Flawed Model
For this reason I generally recommend “micro loading” on
indicator exercises: adding 1.5-­‐2.5 lbs total to the bar every
workout.

With that said you would need to get your hands on fractional
plates because most gyms don’t carry weights under 2.5 lbs.
Ideally, you would get a set of ¼, ½ and 1 lbs plates. This
would give you the luxury to increase the total weight by 0.5
lbs to 3.5 lbs and everywhere in between by the half pound.

If you workout at a fitness club you can easily bring these
weights with you to the gym since they are only a few pounds.

The other option would be to alternate adding 5 lbs to your
first set or your subsequent sets.

So at first you would add 5 lbs to your second and third set.
The next workout you would add 5 lbs to your first set. Then
you would load up your second and third set by 5 lbs.

This method has you increasing all sets by 5 lbs every second
workout. If you are an advanced lifter you may need to treat
each set independently and add 5 lbs to only one of your three
sets each workout.

This method would have you adding 5 lbs every third workout.

Example:

Workout 1: 200 lb x 5; 180 lbs x 6; 160 lbs x 8
Workout 2: 200 lbs x 5; 185 lbs x 6; 165 lbs x 8
Workout 3: 205 lbs x 5; 185 lbs x 6; 165 lbs x 8
Or:

Workout 1: 200 lb x 5, 180 lbs x 6, 160 lbs x 8
Workout 2: 200 lbs x 5, 180 lbs x 6, 165lbs x 8
Workout 3: 200 lbs x 5, 185 lbs x 6, 165 lbs x 8
Workout 4: 205 lbs x 5, 185 lbs x 6, 165 lbs x 8
Assistance Exercise Progression
For assistance exercises there is no need to try and add weight
every workout. I recommend sticking with the same weight
until you can perform all sets for the maximum number of reps.

After you have accomplished this you can increase the weight
by 5 lbs and you can build back up again. So if an exercise calls
for 3 sets of 6-­‐10 reps then you will stick with the same weight
until you can perform all 3 sets for 10 reps.

Try and add one rep every workout to anyone of the 3 sets.

Example for Dumbbell Curls ( 3 sets of 6 -­‐ 10 reps):

Workout 1 – 35 lbs x 7, 6, 6
Workout 2 – 35 lbs x 7, 7, 6
Workout 3 – 35 lbs x 7, 7, 7
Workout 4 – 35 lbs x 8, 7, 7
Workout 5 – 35 lbs x 8, 8, 7
Workout 6 – 35 lbs x 8, 8, 8
Workout 7 – 35 lbs x 9, 8, 8
Workout 8 – 35 lbs x 9, 9, 8
Workout 9 – 35 lbs x 9, 9, 9
Workout 10 – 35 lbs x 10, 9, 9
Workout 11 – 35 lbs x 10, 10, 9
Workout 12 – 35 lbs x 10, 10, 10
Once you build up to 3 sets of 10 reps you will then progress to
the next weight. In this case you will go for 40 lbs dumbbells
for your next workout.

If this rate of progress seems slow to you that’s because it
is.

Slow and steady wins the race in the game of strength and
muscle. Those that try to rush it and think only with their ego
will turn to sloppy form and injury.

With that said, you might be able to progress at a faster rate. If
that’s the case then you can treat your second and third set the
same.

For this you would either be increasing your first set by one
rep or your second and third set by 1 rep. In this scenario your
first set will increase by 1 every other week instead of every
third week.

Example (faster progression):

Workout 1 – 35 lbs x 7, 6, 6
Workout 2 – 35 lbs x 7, 7, 7
Workout 3 – 35 lbs x 8, 7, 7
Workout 4-­‐ 35 lbs x 8, 8, 8
Chapter 6
Optimal Training Frequency
This is a topic of huge debate in any of the forums and
communities out there. In fact, everywhere you go you’ll likely
find a different answer.

Time to put it all to rest right here:

Lifting Days per week
Three strength training sessions per week is the optimal
training frequency for strength and muscle gains.

Taking a day off from lifting between strength training sessions
allows your body to recover. As well this day of rest gives your
central nervous system a chance to recharge.

By lifting only three times per week on non-­‐consecutive days
you can hit the gym with maximum effort and productivity.
You will always be lifting near your true potential and strength
and muscle gains will be maximized.

You will be able to make the maximum rate of gains by
only lifting three times per week.

There is no additional benefit from training 4, 5 or even 6
times per week. In fact, it becomes very counter productive
because recovery capabilities are reduced.

Muscle/Movement Frequency
After an intense lifting session your muscles actually recover
quite quickly. There is tons of research on muscular recovery
indicating that a muscle can be loaded as often as every 48
hours.

But... muscle recovery is only one side of the story.

When lifting heavy you create lots of neural fatigue. You drain
your central nervous system and your local nerves that fire a
particular muscle group. When these nerves are fatigued, a
given muscle group will be short of strength until it's given
enough time to recover.

The CNS takes around 48 hours to recover much like your
muscles. However the local nerves may take three to four days
before they are fully recharged after a heavy lifting session.

For this reason your best bet is to lift every other day or 3x per
week on non-­‐consecutive days. This gives your central nervous
system a chance to fully recharge before your next strength
workout.

In addition you should only hit each muscle group every
four to five days to give the local nerves a chance to fully
recover.

The best way to do this is to split your body into two workouts.

Here’s an example split: Chest, Shoulders, Triceps (Workout A)
and Back, Biceps, Legs (Workout B).

Then simply alternate between these workouts 3x per week.
This is what it would look like:

Week 1:

Monday -­‐ Workout A
Wednesday -­‐ Workout B
Friday -­‐ Workout A
Week 2:

Monday -­‐ Workout B
Wednesday -­‐ Workout A
Friday -­‐ Workout B
Resting a full week before hitting the same muscle group is
generally too much time for maximizing growth and strength
gains.

Protein synthesis returns to normal in a muscle group after a
few days and your muscles strength abilities peak 4 to 5 days
after being trained.

When you wait a full week many of your muscles positive
adaptations start to return to normal during those last 2-­‐3 days
of rest.

Chapter 7
The Kinobody Workout Program for
Strength and Density
Below is one of my favorite workout routines to follow. This
program will allow you to gradually build your physique up to
perfect proportions. It is designed specifically for the “Greek
God” Kinobody physique.

The total volume on each muscle group may seem on the low
end. With that said, as long as you are making strength gains
you will see very solid muscle gains.

After following this routine for 3 months you should see an
increase of 30 -­‐45 lbs on your incline bench press and weighted
chin ups. This big strength increase will lead to a much more
muscular physique.

Workout A: Chest, Shoulders, Triceps

Incline Bench Press: 3 sets (RPT -­‐ 5, 6, 8)
Standing Press: 3 sets (RPT -­‐ 5, 6, 8)
Lateral Raises: 3 sets x 8-­‐12 reps
Skull Crushers: 3 sets x 6 -­‐ 10 reps
Workout B: Back, Biceps, Traps, Legs

Weighted Chin ups: 3 sets (RPT -­‐ 5, 6, 8)
Hang Cleans or Sumo Deads: 3 sets (RPT -­‐ 5, 6, 8)
Bent Over Flyes: 3 sets x 8-­‐12 reps
Barbell Curls: 3 sets x 6-­‐10 reps
Notes on the Workout

The first two exercises of every workout are your key
movements. These exercises are the ones you want to strive to
improve on.

On Workout A you will be doing incline bench press and
standing press. On Workout B you will be performing weighted
chin-­‐ups and hang cleans. The goal will be to add 2.5 lbs each
workout and perform the same number of reps (5, 6 and 8
reps). Conversely you can alternate adding 5 lbs to your second
and third set and 5 lbs to your first set.

Your first work set will be for 5 repetitions. You will then
reduce the weight by 10%, rest 3 minutes and perform your
second set for 6 reps. You will then reduce the weight by 10%
again, rest 3 minutes and perform your final set for 8 reps. For
chin ups use your total weight (bodyweight + additional
weight) when determining 10%.

For your third and fourth exercises you will be sticking to the
same weight for each set. In addition you will only be resting 2
minutes between sets. Stick with the same weight until you
reach the upper threshold of the repetition range.

Example: for barbell curls you will stick with the same weight
every workout until you can perform 10 reps for all 3 sets. The
next workout you will increase the weight by 5 lbs.

You will alternate between Workout A and Workout B
three times per week on non-­‐consecutive days. Therefore
you will perform each workout 6 times over the course of 4
weeks.

Workout Modifications
Workout A: Chest, Shoulders, Triceps

Incline Bench Press: 3 sets (RPT -­‐ 5, 6, 8)
Weighted Dips or Close Grip Bench: 3 sets (RPT -­‐ 6, 8, 10)
Lateral Raises: 3 sets x 8-­‐12 reps
Rope Push Downs: 3 sets x 8-­‐12 reps
Workout B: Back, Biceps, Traps, Legs

Weighted Pull ups: 3 sets (RPT -­‐ 5, 6, 8)
Bent Over Flyes: 3 sets x 8-­‐12 reps
Incline Dumbbell Curls: 3 sets x 6-­‐10 reps
Pistols + Calf Raises: 3 sets x 4-­‐ 6 reps + 10-­‐ 12
Notes on the Workout

For this workout program you will be swapping standing press
for weighted dips or close grip bench. This will give your chest
more work and will help to build more prominent pecs. The
shoulders will still get plenty of indirect work from incline
bench and dips plus specific work from lateral raises.

You will also be swapping chin ups for pull ups (hands facing
away). This will give your lats a little bit more work. You will
also be swapping hang cleans for pistol squats superset with
calf raises. You will perform 4-­‐ 6 reps of the pistol squat
followed by 10-­‐12 reps of the single leg calf raise. This will give
your legs a little bit more work.

Lastly you will be switching up your biceps and triceps
exercises to keep progress coming along.

Chapter 8
Specialization Routines
For rapid muscle growth I recommend using specialization
routines. This is the only way to force muscle growth at a
quicker rate.

You simply can’t increase volume on all of your muscle groups.
Doing so would invite overtraining and strength regression.

Therefore the solution is to pick one muscle group on each
workout day and add more volume to it.

Stick with the same specialization workouts for 6 weeks before
changing.

Chest Specialization
Workout A: Chest, Shoulders, Triceps

Incline Bench Press: 5 sets (RPT -­‐ 5, 6, 8, 8, 8)
Flat Bench Press: 3 sets (RPT -­‐ 6, 8, 10)
Lateral Raises: 3 sets x 8-­‐12 reps
Skull Crushers: 3 sets x 6-­‐ 10 reps
Notes on the Workout

For this workout you will be adding 2 additional sets to incline
bench press. This extra volume will speed up muscle growth.
Use the same weight for the last 3 sets. If you are unable to get
the full 8 reps that’s fine; do what you can.

In addition you will be performing flat bench press for your
second exercise. This is a great overall mass builder to the
chest. In conjunction with incline bench it will build the chest
exceptionally well.

Shoulder Specialization
Workout A: Chest, Shoulders, Triceps

Standing Press: 5 sets (RPT -­‐ 5, 6, 8, 8, 8)
Weighted Dips or Close Grip Bench: 3 sets (RPT -­‐ 5, 6, 8)
Lateral Raises: 3 sets x 8-­‐12 reps
Skull Crushers: 3 sets x 8-­‐12 reps
Notes on the Workout

For this workout you will be adding 2 additional sets to
standing press. For standing press use the same weight for the
last 3 sets.

Triceps Specialization
Workout A: Chest, Shoulders, Triceps

Incline Bench Press: 3 sets (RPT -­‐ 5, 6, 8)
Weighted Dips or Close Grip Bench: 3 sets (RPT -­‐ 6, 8, 10)
Lateral Raises: 3 sets x 8-­‐12 reps
Skull Crushers: 3 sets x 6-­‐ 10 reps
Rope Extensions: 2 sets x 10-­‐ 12
Notes on the Workout

For this workout you will add an extra triceps exercise to the
end of the workout. Keep the rest between 60-­‐90 seconds on
rope extensions.

Back Specialization
Workout B: Back, Biceps, Traps, Legs

Weighted Pull ups: 5 sets (RPT -­‐ 5, 6, 8, 8, 8)
Hang Cleans or Sumo Deads: 3 sets (RPT -­‐ 5, 6, 8)
Bent Over Flyes: 3 sets x 8-­‐ 1 2 reps
Barbell Curls: 3 sets x 6-­‐10 reps
Notes on the Workout

For this workout you will perform pull-­‐ups instead of chin-­‐ups.

In addition you will be performing 5 sets total. If you are
unable to perform at-­‐least 5 reps on the last 3 sets you can
switch over to lat pull down for the last 2-­‐3 sets.

Biceps Specialization
Workout B: Back, Biceps, Traps, Legs

Weighted Close Grip Chin ups: 3 sets (RPT -­‐ 5, 6, 8)
Barbell Curls: 3 sets x 6-­‐ 10 reps
Incline Dumbbell Curls: 2 sets x 8-­‐12 reps
Bent Over Flyes: 3 sets x 8-­‐12 reps
Pistols + Calf Raises: 3 sets x 3-­‐5 reps + 10-­‐ 12
Notes on the Workout

For this workout you will add an extra biceps exercise to the
end of the workout. Keep the rest between 60-­‐90 seconds on
incline dumbbell curls

Legs Specialization
Workout B: Back, Biceps, Traps, Legs

Squat: 3 sets (RPT -­‐ 5, 6, 8)
Calf Raises: 3 sets x 8-­‐12 reps
Weighted Chin ups: 3 sets (RPT -­‐ 5, 6, 8)
Bent Over Flyes: 3 sets x 8-­‐12 reps
Barbell Curls: 3 sets x 6-­‐10 reps
Notes on the Workout

For this workout you will be performing the squat. The squat is
so powerful at building leg mass that most people don’t need to
use this exercise for very long.

If you have slim legs this is a good routine to use. If you don’t
want to get your legs bigger then I would recommend avoiding
this routine.

You should be adding 5 lbs to the bar every squat workout.
This is because squats progress at a faster rate than upper
body movements.

If you do not wish to perform the barbell back squat you can
perform the pistol squat instead. Perform 3 sets of the pistol

squat slow and controlled. If possible, use weight on your first
one to two sets.

Example:

Set 1 – 40 lbs x 5 (or Set 1 – 20 lbs x 5)
Set 2 – 20 lbs x 6 (or Set 2 – bw* x 6)
Set 3 – bw x 8 (or Set 3 – bw x 6)
*bw = bodyweight
Chapter 9
Minimum Effort Growth Acceleration
(MEGA Training)
If you want maximum muscle gains while maintaining a low
body fat then you will need to exploit an additional training
technique.

The training technique is known to bodybuilders as pump
training or “fatigue training”.

With pump training you will be able to add an additional 5-­‐ 8
lbs of ‘pretty muscle’ from increased glycogen storage and
sarcoplasm in the muscles. The good news is that this type of
growth comes quite quickly and it doesn’t take much to trigger
it.

Unfortunately this type of muscle gain can be considered
temporary.

As long as you maintain your training volume you will have
this additional size. Consequently if you were to take 2 or more
weeks off lifting you would gradually start to notice your
muscles flattening out and losing this additional size.

Furthermore this muscle gain is very sensitive to dieting
and carbohydrates. If you were to go on a low calorie/carb
diet you would definitely notice some initial muscle loss.

This is why I absolutely love heavy lifting!

The muscle you gain from heavy lifting is there to last. You can
maintain it indefinitely with a very low training volume. You
can go on a long term dieting stint and not lose an ounce of
muscle. As well you can embark on a 3+ week vacation and
look just as muscular when you come home as when you left.

Not to mention the muscle you gain with heavy lifting will have
a profound effect on strength and power.

More on Pump Training
Think of the muscle growth you get from pump training as the
cherry on top of your overall routine.

If you want to have exceptional muscle development then you
will need to incorporate pump training in your program.

However you should never let pump training take priority
over heavy lifting. Heavy lifting in the 4-­‐ 8 -­‐rep range is what
is going to deliver the biggest bang for your buck. If you get
strong in the 4-­‐8 rep range you will be building a whole lot of
muscle.

For this reason I like to set up the MEGA workout into two
sections.

The first section is dedicated to heavy lifting, reverse
pyramid style. This is where you will be taking plenty of rest
and your goal will be to move the heaviest weight possible in
the 4-­‐8 rep range.

The second section of the workout will be dedicated
towards pump training, standard pyramid style.

This is where you will be focused on burning out and depleting
your muscle. Lighter weights will be used with higher reps and
shorter rest periods.

The combination of heavy lifting and pump training will deliver
the greatest muscle growth. However this type of training is
very demanding on the body.

If you don’t supply the proper amount of nutrients then you
will not grow or even get stronger.

Therefore the MEGA workout is only appropriate while
following a well-­‐planned recomp or lean bulk diet.

If you’re on a cutting program or slacking off on your nutrition
then you should not follow the MEGA Training Program.

Chapter 10
Standard Pyramid Training:
Ultimate Pump Lifting
For pump lifting I like to use standard pyramid training. This
will deliver one heck of a muscle pump and will create a super
glycogen compensation effect. You will be depleting a fair
amount of muscle glycogen with this type of training. As a
result your body will adapt by storing more glycogen in the
muscles to better handle future training. This extra glycogen
will make your muscles bigger and fuller.

As well, this type of lifting triggers sarcoplasmic
hypertrophy. This is a type of muscle growth, which leads to
increased fluid in the muscles.

With standard pyramid training the goal is to really fatigue
your muscles and maximize volume. For that reason rest
between sets should be short, 30-­‐60 seconds top.

You should also be performing several sets, 4-­‐6 would be ideal.

You want to be using the same weight for all sets with
Standard Pyramid Training. Your first set should be around 12
reps. As fatigue sets in on your subsequent sets you will be
performing less and less reps. For that reason I recommend
doing 12, 10, 8, and 6 reps. To maximize total depletion and
glycogen super compensation you can add two more sets of 6
reps (ex: 12, 10, 8, 6, 6, 6).

Setting Up Standard Pyramid Training
To really amplify the glycogen super compensation effect you
can reduce the weight by 10 -­‐15% and perform 2-­‐3 additional
sets.

Example:

30 lbs – 12, 10, 8, 6, 6, 6
Followed by 25 lbs – 10, 8, 6
Best Exercises for Standard Pyramid Training
The best exercises for this type of training tend to be isolation
movements.

Compound movements are too demanding on the body to be
performed with such a high volume. I like to strictly use
compound, free weight movements for heavy lifting and
isolation movements for high volume pump training.

Chest: Incline DB Flyes or Machine Flyes
Shoulders: Dumbbell Lateral Raises
Back: Cable Rows superset with Bent Over Flyes
Triceps: Rope Extensions
Biceps: Cable Curls
Legs: Calf Raises
Progressing on Standard Pyramid Training

The goal of standard pyramid training is to perform a set
amount of work (weight x sets x reps) as fast as possible.

Therefore the most natural way to improve is to reduce the
rest between sets so you are performing the same amount of
work in less time.

You might start with 60 seconds rest between sets and
gradually work your way to shorter and shorter rest periods.
Eventually you may find that you require only 20-­‐30 seconds
rest between sets. It is at this point that you want to add
weight and start back at 60 seconds of rest between sets.

Each workout try to knock off 5 seconds of rest between
sets.

Workouts Per Week

Alternate between Workout A and Workout B for a total of
three workouts per week on non-­‐consecutive days. This

method will have you performing each workout once every
four to five days.

Notes on the Workout

For these workouts you will perform one RPT movement for
each muscle group and one SPT movement for each muscle
group.

For the RPT movements you will be taking plenty of rest, 3-­‐ 4
minutes between sets. Your goal will be to add 5 lbs to anyone
of your 3 sets. Remember load your third set first, the next
workout load your second set and your third workout load
your first set.

Repeat this process continually so that every third workout
you will have increased all 3 sets by 5 lbs.

Alternatively you can load your second and third set together
so that every second workout you will increase all 3 sets by 5
lbs. This is more suited for beginner and intermediate lifters.
Advanced lifters require a slower progression model.

For the SPT movements you will be switching to isolation
exercises and going for higher reps and shorter rest periods.
The goal here is muscle depletion to trigger increased glycogen
storage and sarcoplasm in the muscles. Pick a weight that you
can do 12 reps with. Limit rest to 30-­‐60 seconds and perform
12, 10, 8 and 6 reps with the same weight.

In each workout, aim to reduce the rest between sets by 5-­‐ 10
seconds. Once you are down to only 30 seconds rest between
sets increase the weight and start back at 60 seconds between

sets. For ‘Workout B’ you will perform barbell squats, deadlifts
or hang cleans.

Pick the variation of your choice. If you want to avoid building
your legs then go with hang cleans or single leg pistol squats.

As well you will superset cable rows with bent over flyes.

Notes on the Workout

Everything is the same for the level 2 MEGA Workout. The only
difference is that you will be performing an additional two sets

On exercises with ** you will drop the weight by 10-­‐15% after
completing 6 sets. You will then perform two additional sets
for 6-­‐10 reps. Rest 30-­‐60 seconds between these two sets.

Chapter 12
Nutrition Strategies for Building
Muscle & Avoiding Fat Gain
Nutrition for building muscle is actually very simple: eat plenty
of food and include lots of protein and carbs.

If you follow this protocol and workout you will definitely
build muscle. However, when the goal is to build muscle and
keep fat gain to an absolute minimum, things become much
more complicated.

Your body can only use so many surplus calories for
muscle growth and storage. Eventually any additional
calories will be stored as fat.

In order to ensure you build muscle without gaining fat you
need to be diligent in tracking your food intake.

Eat too few calories and muscle growth will not occur at any
meaningful rate. Eat too many calories and unpleasant fat gain
will occur.

For that reason we need to find the amount of weekly surplus
calories you can handle before fat gain occurs. For most people
this is around 2000 surplus calories per week or slightly less.
This works out to be an extra 285 calories per day.

Most guys trying to build muscle try and eat 500 calories over
maintenance per day. Those extra 215 calories tend to get
stored as fat.

Instead of eating 285 extra calories each and every day it’s
better to place more calories on lifting days and less calories on
rest days.

This will lead to slightly better muscle gains since you will be
providing the most calories on days where your body is primed
for muscle growth.

Lean Bulk Protocol
Rest Days (4x per week) +100 calories over maintenance
Lifting Days (3x per week) +500 calories over
maintenance
Weekly  
  Calorie  
  Surplus  
  =    
  1900 
  calories 
Modification #1

If you tend to gain fat easily then you can reduce calories
slightly on rest days.

Instead of eating +100 calories on rest days you could eat -­‐ 100
calories on rest days.

Rest Days (4x per week) -­‐100 calories under maintenance
Lifting Days (3x per week) +500 calories over
maintenance
Weekly  
  Calorie  
  Surplus  
  =    
  1100 
  calories 
Recomp Protocol
If you want to focus on building muscle and losing fat at a slow
rate then it’s better to use a recomp protocol.

This is where you will eat at a calorie surplus on training days
to encourage muscle growth and a calorie deficit on rest days
to encourage fat loss.

At the end of the week you will have eaten very close to
maintenance but it is likely you will have improved your body
composition (more muscle and less fat).

Rest Days (4x per week) -­‐300 calories under maintenance
Lifting Days (3x per week) +400 calories over
maintenance
Weekly  
  Calorie  
  Surplus  
  =    
  0
It’s best to use a modest calorie surplus/deficit on lifting/rest
days.

Having to go too low in calories on rest days and muscle
recovery and growth will be compromised. As well going too
high in calories on training days will inevitably lead to fat spill
over. So instead of building a little muscle on training days and
losing a little fat on rest day you will be gaining muscle and fat
on training days and losing muscle and fat on rest days.

Obviously big calorie swings between lifting/rest days aren’t
optimal. Therefore using a 300-­‐400 calorie surplus/deficit is
your best option.

Determining Maintenance Level Calories
Without knowing your maintenance intake of calories, none of
the protocols will be very helpful.

Fortunately determining your maintenance calorie intake is
rather simple. Assuming 60 minutes of physical activity per
day, most people burn 15 calories per pound of bodyweight.

Now obviously this is just an estimate. It is very unlikely that
these numbers will be exact. However there is a very strong
chance that you will be within shooting distance of the
numbers calculated.

If you are gaining weight too quickly then you can lower your
maintenance level calories by 10%. If you are not gaining
weight or gaining weight too slowly then you can increase your
maintenance level calories by 10%.

Eventually you will be able to zone in on your approximate
maintenance level calorie intake.

Example for 160 lbs guy:

Maintenance level calories: 160 x 15 = 2400 calories

Rest Days (4x per week) = 2500 calories (+100)
Lifting Days (3x per week) = 2900 calories (+500)

Determining Protein, Fat & Carb Intake
Of secondary importance to calorie intake is the make up of
those calories.

The first thing that you must do is to ensure you are consuming
adequate dietary protein.

Since protein is essential for muscle growth this is the number
one priority in regards to macronutrient intake. Before even
worrying about how much fat and carbs to eat you need to first
determine your protein needs.

Most research indicates that the maximum amount of
protein needed to support muscle growth is 1.8 grams per
kg (or 0.8 grams per pound) of bodyweight, but I feel
consuming slightly more protein than this is beneficial.

Since we need to be careful not to overeat and cause fat gain it
makes sense to eat lots of protein to stay full and satisfied.

For this reason I recommend eating one gram of protein per
pound of goal bodyweight. As long as you include high protein
foods in your meals it will be relatively easy to reach this
amount. If you have trouble eating this much protein you are
welcome to include protein shakes into your diet.

So if you are 160 lbs and your goal is to be 175 lbs then aim for
175 grams of protein per day. Don’t set your protein intake
more than 15 over your current weight in pounds. So if you’re
160 lbs and your goal weight is 180 lbs then set your protein
intake at a maximum of 175 grams per day.

When you are within 15 lbs of your goal weight then you can
adjust your protein intake up to 180 grams.

The next macronutrient to set is fat intake. Fat should
make up 20-­‐30% of total calories.

Going too low in fat will leave you hungry between meals and
will make your meals blander. As well low fat diets may
negatively impact testosterone levels. Use 25% of total calories
as the default for fat intake.

If you prefer to include more fat in exchange for carbs you can
adjust this number up to 30%. If you prefer less fat and more
carbs you can adjust this number down to 20%.

A fat intake of between 20-­‐30% of total calories will leave the
largest percentage of your calories to come from
carbohydrates.

This is an ideal scenario for building muscle. A high intake of
carbohydrates will ensure that you maintain full glycogen
stores in your muscles. Your body is more efficient at building
muscle and being in an anabolic state when your glycogen
stores are full or near full.

In addition, carbs are the most efficient energy source and
sufficient carbs will ensure optimal training performance.

The better and more intense your workouts are the more
muscle growth you will promote.

To calculate fat intake you must multiply calories per
day by 0.25 (25%) and then divide that number by 9 to
get grams of fat per day.
To calculate carb intake you will need to add together
fat calories and protein calories. Subtract this number
from total calories per day. This will provide you with the
number of calories to consume from carbs per day. Divide
this number by 4 to get carbs per day in grams.
Meal Frequency & Distribution
Assuming you are hitting the appropriate amount of calories
and macronutrients, then meal frequency isn’t awfully
important.

In fact, whether you eat two meals or six meals won’t make an
ounce of a difference. For that reason I recommend sticking to
the meal pattern that you enjoy the most.

For most people, having to eat 5+ meals per day is a pain in the
ass. Most people I find do best on 2-­‐4 meals per day. The
biggest meals should come in the evening and after training.

This I find maximizes fat burning during the day and amplifies
glycogen storage in the muscles from training. As well, big
meals early in the day tend to cause tiredness.

Lastly this eating pattern tends to be the most enjoyable and
satisfying.

My recommended plan is to skip breakfast, eat a moderate
sized lunch, train in the afternoon, have a big dinner with
plenty of carbs post workout and then another big meal 1-­‐ 2
hours before going to bed.

If you train in the evening then it would be better to eat a
moderate sized lunch, another moderate sized meal 2-­‐3 hours
before training and a big dinner post workout.

If you train earlier in the day then it’s best to take 10 grams of
BCAA before training, have a normal sized lunch, a big dinner
and another meal 3-­‐4 hours later (2 hours before going to bed).

Example Meal Schedule

Wake up – 8am
Meal 1 – 2pm (protein salad or 2% Greek Yogurt and almonds)
Workout – 5:00pm
Meal 2 – 6:30pm (animal protein and rice, potatoes or yams)
Meal 3 – 10pm (animal protein and rice, potatoes or yams)

Sample Meal Plan #1:

Meal 1:

Plain greek yogurt or cottage cheese
handful of almonds
serving of fruit
Meal 2 & 3 :

Chicken breast
brown rice cooked in 1-­‐2tbs of coconut oil
veggies and spinach salad
Sample Meal Plan #2:

Meal 1:

Salad loaded with grilled chicken breast (sliced)
tomatoes, cucumbers, shredded cheese and avocado
serving of fruit
Meal 2 & 3:

Beef (flank steak, 90% lean ground beef, roast beef)
potatoes or sweet potatoes
butter (for taste)
veggies and spinach salad
What About Breakfast?
I recommend skipping breakfast.

I can already hear the comments... “Skip breakfast? Are you
crazy?”

There is really no good reason to eat breakfast. By pushing
your first meal later into the day you force your body to burn
fat for fuel, you elevate growth hormone and you increase
insulin sensitivity in the muscles. This creates the perfect
storm for building muscle and burning fat.

As long as you limit the daily fast to 16-­‐18 hours there will
be no muscle catabolism during the fast.

When you do eat, after an extended fast, the anabolic effects of
that meal will be much greater. This is due to improvements in
your muscles insulin sensitivity. This leads to greater nutrition
partitioning into your muscles stores.

I have found that by skipping breakfast I have had a much
easier time building muscle while maintaining leanness.

That said it is essential that you provide your body with the
right amount of nutrition during the feasting window. If you
are incapable getting in the appropriate amount of calories in 2-­‐
3 large meals then fasting is probably not for you.

If you wish to perform the strength training before your
first meal then I strongly recommend taking 10 grams of
BCAA before training.

Pre workout protein is highly beneficial at increasing protein
synthesis and preventing protein breakdown. Therefore it
makes sense to provide your body with 10g of BCAA before
training.

Chapter 13
Tracking Progress
One of the main reasons why people fail to follow through on
their workout program and nutrition plan is because of a lack
of accountability.

They make it extremely easy for themselves to miss workouts,
half ass it in the gym and not follow their diet regime.

This is simply unacceptable!

By purchasing this program you made the decision right then
and there that you no longer wanted to settle for a mediocre
body.
You wanted to rise above and beyond and achieve an awe-­‐
inspiring condition. I’m talking about the level of physical
development which brings with it enormous amounts of self-­‐
respect and confidence.

I want you to commit to following this workout program
with absolute consistency and dedication.

That    
  you  
  will 
  do   
  whatever 
  it   
  takes    
  to   
  hit  
  the  
  gym  
  three    
times   
  per  
  week 
  with 
  extraordinary    
  effort   
  and  
  drive.   
No  
  matter   
  what,    
  you  
  will 
  not  
  sabotage 
  your 
  efforts  
by  
  rationalizing    
  skipping 
  the  
  gym  
  or   
  screwing 
  up   
your    
  diet.    
The reason most people have so much difficulty following
through on a workout plan is because they make up excuses for

why they can’t hit the gym. They lie to themselves that it will
just be this one time and that the following weeks will be
perfect.

The truth is that if you are going to skip a workout now
then you will do so again in the future.

You need to hold yourself accountable and do whatever it takes
to drag yourself to the gym.

I have never met anyone in my life that couldn’t find one hour
to workout three times per week. If something comes up then
shift things around and make it work.

There is simply no excuse for not being able to workout three
times per week. End of story.

Making This Plan Work
To really maximize your results on this program it is essential
that you track your strength and physique progress. By doing
so you will improve your results dramatically.

When you are tracking your progress then missing a workout
or just going through the motions in the gym has real,
substantial consequences.

Tracking progress is the most effective way to keep yourself
disciplined and accountable for your actions.

Progress Tracking #1: Lifts

Every workout you should be recording and tracking your
main lifts. Your main core lifts are incline bench press and
weighted chin ups.

If you follow the progression scheme correctly you will be
adding 10-­‐15 lbs per month to each of these lifts.

If you’re a beginner you will be adding 15 lbs per month and if
you’re advanced you will be adding 10 lbs per month.
Beginners will alternate adding 5 lbs to their second and third
set or their first set each workout. Advanced lifters will add 5
lbs to only one of their three sets per workouts.

Stick with this workout plan for 6 months and you will
become an absolute beast!

If you’re only capable of doing chin ups for 5 reps with 15 lbs
then you could get up to 75-­‐105 lbs for 5 reps in 6 months. If
you are incline bench pressing 135 lbs for 5 reps then in 6
months you could get up to 195-­‐225 lbs.

If you are consistent and you put in a maximum effort when
you are at the gym then you will experience these incredible
results.

Trust me that when you are capable doing weighted chins with
90 lbs strapped to you and incline benching 225 your physique
will be extremely muscular.

Combine that with a low body fat and you will be dropping
jaws.

Progress Tracking #2: Weight and Waist Measurement

Each week you should be weighing yourself and measuring
your waist circumference around bellybutton with normal
relaxed posture (no sucking in or flexing). If you are slowly
gaining weight, about half a pound per week, and your waist is
staying the same then you know you are building pure muscle.
This is very good. If you are recomping and staying around the
same weight but your waist is becoming smaller then you
know you are gaining muscle and losing fat.

Now on the other hand if your waist measurement is going up
then you know you are overdoing it with your calorie intake.
Therefore you would want to cut the calories back to eliminate
fat gain.

Make sure to weigh yourself the same day each week. Weigh
yourself and measure your waist first thing in the morning
after using the bathroom if required. This will provide the
greatest accuracy.

Progress Tracking #3: Muscle Measurements

Each month I recommend taking a few additional
measurements to get the full picture. This will give you an idea
of how exactly your body is changing.

I recommend measuring the chest with relaxed posture at mid
chest level, no flexing in or sticking out the chest.

I also recommend measuring your arms. The best way to
measure the arms is by flexing them and measuring around the
widest point, usually right in the middle of the biceps.

Take this measurement first thing in the morning. If you
measure after a workout you will notice a slightly bigger

reading. This is only temporary so it doesn’t count.
Progress Tracking #4: Photos

A picture says a thousand words! A picture can say so much
more than a number.

For that reason it is wise to take regular, monthly pictures to
track progress.

I recommend taking pictures in the morning and in the same
lighting conditions each time.

Here are the pictures I recommend taking:

1. Front    
  pose 
  relaxed, 
  flexed   
  abs  
  and  
  double   
  biceps   
  pose 
2. Back 
  pose 
  relaxed  
  and  
  double   
  biceps   
  pose
3. Side 
  pose 
  flexed   
  triceps  
  and  
  side 
  pose 
  flexed   
  biceps

Kinobody Fitness Standards
I was always very motivated when I had certain targets to
reach, whether it was 20 consecutive chin ups, 8% body fat or
a 300+ lbs bench.

I just always loved fitness books that provided elite standards
to strive for.

I am now going to provide you with my Kinobody Fitness
Standards for achieving the strong and sexy Greek God
Physique.

I am using three different levels of development: good,
great and godlike.

“Good” is someone who is in above average shape.
“Great” is someone who is in top shape.
“Godlike” is someone who is befitting of a god, someone
in such spectacular shape that you can’t possible fathom
that they are in fact merely human.
Strength Standards
Incline Bench Press

Good – 1x bodyweight for 5 reps
Great – 1.2x bodyweight for 5 reps
Godlike – 1.4x bodyweight for 5 reps

Weighted Chin ups

Good – 30% bodyweight attached for 5 reps
Great – 50% bodyweight attached for 5 reps
Godlike – 70% bodyweight attached for 5 reps

Standing Barbell Press

Good – 0.7x bodyweight for 5 reps
Great – 0.85x bodyweight for 5 reps
Godlike – 1x bodyweight for 5 reps

Barbell Curl

Good – 0.55x bodyweight for 5 reps
Great – 0.65x bodyweight for 5 reps
Godlike – 0.75x bodyweight for 5 reps

Body Measurements Standards
Here are the measurements for being considered godlike:

Waist

Good – 47% of height
Great – 46% of height
Godlike– 45% of height

Chest

Good – 1.3x waist
Great – 1.35x waist
