# Meal Prep Variety Improvements

## Summary of Optimizations

I've successfully implemented comprehensive variety improvements to the meal prep generation system. These enhancements ensure users receive diverse, exciting meal plans while maintaining exact nutritional requirements.

### 1. Enhanced AI Prompts
- Updated system prompts to prioritize variety as a CRITICAL requirement
- Added explicit instructions to avoid generic recipe names
- Included recipe naming examples (good vs bad)
- Required specific, appetizing names with cuisines/cooking methods

### 2. Recipe History Tracking
- Implemented Redis-based tracking of the last 30 generated recipes
- System checks recent recipes before generating new ones
- Prevents repetition by explicitly telling AI which recipes to avoid
- 2-week cache duration ensures long-term variety

### 3. Variety Requirements Added
**Single Day Plans:**
- Different protein source in each meal
- Different carb source in each meal
- Different cooking methods for each meal
- Unique flavor profiles and cuisines

**7-Day Plans:**
- At least 5 different protein sources per week
- At least 5 different carb sources per week
- Maximum 2 repetitions of any recipe throughout the week
- No consecutive day repetitions
- Rotation through different cuisines

### 4. Time-Based Variety Seed
- Added generation timestamp to prompts
- Helps AI generate different recipes even with similar requirements
- Ensures variety across multiple generations

### 5. User Preference Integration
- System now considers user's favorite ingredients
- Avoids ingredients marked as restricted
- Personalized variety based on individual preferences

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
1. **services/openai_meal_service.py**
   - Enhanced system prompts for both single-day and 7-day generation
   - Added `_track_generation_request()` method
   - Implemented `_get_recent_recipes()` and `_save_recipes_to_cache()`
   - Updated prompts to include recent recipes to avoid

2. **app.py**
   - Added user_id to meal generation requests
   - Ensures variety tracking works for authenticated users

### Example Variety Output:
Instead of generic names like "Chicken & Rice", the system now generates:
- Mediterranean Grilled Chicken Quinoa Salad
- Pan-Seared Salmon with Brown Rice and Asparagus
- BBQ Turkey Meatballs with Sweet Potato Wedges
- Thai Basil Beef Stir-Fry with Jasmine Rice
- Mexican Chipotle Turkey Bowl with Cilantro Lime Rice

## Testing
Created `test_variety_generation.py` to verify:
- Recipe history tracking
- Variety in proteins and carbs
- User preference integration
- No repetition between generations

## Future Enhancements
1. Add cuisine preference tracking (e.g., "had Mexican yesterday, try Asian today")
2. Seasonal ingredient rotation
3. User feedback loop to learn preferences over time
4. Weekly theme options (Mediterranean Week, Asian Fusion Week, etc.)
